	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine which academic and affective student factors were significant to student success in a mastery learning program in developmental mathematics and to determine if the mastery learning program led to increased mathematical knowledge retention and success in the subsequent math course. The first phase of the study involved 298 students in developmental mathematics. Using binary logistic regression, the researcher found that placement test score, previous experience with mastery learning, and gender were statistically significant factors related to student success in the mastery learning program. The second phase of the study involved 529 students in the subsequent course intermediate algebra. Using one-way analysis of variance and chi-square methods, the researcher found that mastery learning students retained significantly more mathematical content knowledge and succeeded at significantly higher rates in the subsequent course intermediate algebra as compared to students who took developmental mathematics through traditional methods and those who opted out of placement testing. Results of the study showed that the mastery learning approach in developmental mathematics which incorporated the affective student domain offered advantages for assisting students to overcome math background and self-efficacy barriers.

This paper begins with the idea that mathematics education has much to gain from perspectives in Latin@ studies. I draw on the work of Gloria Anzaldúa, specifically her concepts of “conocimiento” and “Nepantla” to bring a more holistic/connected perspective to the “knowledge” teachers may need for teaching and highlight how it might align with broader definitions of mathematics. I also offer examples from a partnership with a Chicago high school to show how pre-service teachers move through cycles of knowledge construction. Implications for teacher education, and teacher recruitment are discussed.},

	abstract = {Perceived self-efficacy, motivation, and the presence of mentors and role models have value as predictors of career choice and student success. To understand these constructs within the domain of construction education, a quantitative survey was administered to students enrolled in construction management courses (n = 468) at two large universities. Study results revealed that mean perceived self-efficacy toward construction education was significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) higher for construction management (CM) students who report having a role model. Further, CM students who report having a mentor reported a higher mean level of motivation to successfully complete construction education programs and courses (p = 0.015). Differences in self-efficacy and motivation toward construction education between male (n = 410) and female (n = 56) students suggest that female CM students have higher motivation towards construction education (p = 0.024) than their male counterparts. However, due to unequal gender distribution in the sample, coupled with violations of t test assumptions, gender-based findings should be interpreted with caution. This study indicates that students who report having a mentor or role model have higher self-efficacy and motivation toward construction education compared to students without a mentor or role model. The instrument adapted and utilized in the current study can be used to investigate these pertinent construction education-domain specific constructs in order to understand the influence of others on students' academic decisions and performance.},

Aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between self-efficacy and academic achievement in high school students.
Method
In this study, 250 students in the academic year 2010/2011 were selected by means of multistage cluster sampling and completed self-efficacy scale. To measure achievement score grade point average in classes was used. To analyze data correlation coefficient and regression analysis was used.
Results
analysis of data revealed that self-evaluation, selfdirecting and self-regulation are correlated with academic achievement. Among all variables entered in the equation model only self-evaluation and self-regulation entered the regression model explaining 10 percent variance of academic achievement in 2 steps.
Conclusion
according to the results, self-efficacy is a considerable factor in academic achievement.},

Self-regulation is a metacognitive function essential to academic success. Students with LD are notoriously poor at self-regulation and must be taught explicitly to monitor and control their cognitive activities as they engage in academic tasks such as mathematical problem solving. This article describes intervention studies that use self-regulation strategies to improve mathematics performance of students with LD at the elementary, middle, and secondary school levels. Several techniques to facilitate effective implementation of self-regulation instruction in the classroom are presented.},

Students at a small, regional college in the southeast were surveyed at the beginning and end of their first semester of enrollment.

Correlational analyses partly confirmed and partly disconfirmed our expectations in a sample of 409 first-year psychology students. Consistent with the literature, intellectual ability and achievement motivation were associated positively with academic success. For the meaning directed, reproduction directed and application directed learning style, no positive association with academic success could be detected. The undirected learning style, however, appeared to be a consistent negative predictor. For the Big Five personality factors (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience), a consistent, positive association for conscientiousness with academic success was found. The very first examination at the university came out as the most important predictor for academic success, even after two and three years of study.
