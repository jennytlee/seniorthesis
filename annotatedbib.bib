While whiteness is receiving more attention in the broader education literature, only a handful of scholars address whiteness in mathematics education in any form. This lack of attention to whiteness leaves it invisible and neutral in documenting mathematics as a racialized space. Naming White institutional spaces, as well as the mechanisms that oppress students, can provide those who work in the field of mathematics education with specific ideas about combatting these racist structures. The framework developed and presented here illustrates three dimensions of White institutional space—institutional, labor, and identity—that are intended to support mathematics educators in two ways: (a) systematically documenting how whiteness subjugates historically marginalized students of color and their agency in resisting this oppression, and (b) making visible the ways in which whiteness impacts White students to reproduce racial privilege.},

In Study 1 we demonstrated that the pattern observed in the literature that women underperform on difficult (but not easy) math tests was observed among a highly selected sample of men and women. In Study 2 we demonstrated that this difference in performance could be eliminated when we lowered stereotype threat by describing the test as not producing gender differences. However, when the test was described as producing gender differences and stereotype threat was high, women performed substantially worse than equally qualified men did. A third experiment replicated this finding with a less highly selected population and explored the mediation of the effect. The implication that stereotype threat may underlie gender differences in advanced math performance, even those that have been attributed to genetically rooted sex differences, is discussed.},

Focus Of Study: This research was animated by the nagging question of the association of family income with SAT performance.

More importantly, how strong are the effects of poverty on SAT performance?

Abundant research has demonstrated gender bias in many demographic groups, but has yet to experimentally investigate whether science faculty exhibit a bias against female students that could contribute to the gender disparity in academic science. In a randomized double-blind study (n = 127), science faculty from research-intensive universities rated the application materials of a student—who was randomly assigned either a male or female name—for a laboratory manager position. Faculty participants rated the male applicant as significantly more competent and hireable than the (identical) female applicant. These participants also selected a higher starting salary and offered more career mentoring to the male applicant. The gender of the faculty participants did not affect responses, such that female and male faculty were equally likely to exhibit bias against the female student. Mediation analyses indicated that the female student was less likely to be hired because she was viewed as less competent. We also assessed faculty participants’ preexisting subtle bias against women using a standard instrument and found that preexisting subtle bias against women played a moderating role, such that subtle bias against women was associated with less support for the female student, but was unrelated to reactions to the male student. These results suggest that interventions addressing faculty gender bias might advance the goal of increasing the participation of women in science.},

	abstract = {Women's representation in science has changed substantially, but unevenly, over the past 40 years. In health and biological sciences, for example, women's representation among U.S. scientists is now on par with or greater than men's, while in physical sciences and engineering they remain a clear minority. We investigated whether variation in proportions of women in scientific disciplines is related to differing levels of male-favoring explicit or implicit stereotypes held by students and scientists in each discipline. We hypothesized that science-is-male stereotypes would be weaker in disciplines where women are better represented. This prediction was tested with a sample of 176,935 college-educated participants (70\% female), including thousands of engineers, physicians, and scientists. The prediction was supported for the explicit stereotype, but not for the implicit stereotype. Implicit stereotype strength did not correspond with disciplines' gender ratios, but, rather, correlated with two indicators of disciplines' scientific intensity, positively for men and negatively for women. From age 18 on, women who majored or worked in disciplines perceived as more scientific had substantially weaker science-is-male stereotypes than did men in the same disciplines, with gender differences larger than 0.8 standard deviations in the most scientifically-perceived disciplines. Further, particularly for women, differences in the strength of implicit stereotypes across scientific disciplines corresponded with the strength of scientific values held by women in the disciplines. These results are discussed in the context of dual process theory of mental operation and balanced identity theory. The findings point to the need for longitudinal study of the factors' affecting development of adults' and, especially, children's implicit gender stereotypes and scientific identity.},

	abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

	title = {"{Flipping}" the classroom to explore active learning in a large undergraduate course},
	abstract = {In traditional approaches to teaching engineering classes, the instructor plays the role of
information conveyor, while the students assume a receiver role with primary responsibilities of
listening and note-taking. Research into how students learn suggests that students need to be
more actively engaged with the course material to maximize their understanding. The literature
contains many examples of active learning strategies, such as teams solving problems in class
and the use of student response systems with conceptual questions. Incorporating active learning
strategies into a class means that there will be less time for delivering material via lecture.
Therefore, instructors who choose to utilize active learning strategies must find ways to ensure
that all required course content is still addressed.

This paper discusses an instructional technique called the “classroom flip” model which was
assessed in a larger, undergraduate architectural engineering class. In this model, lecture content
is removed from the classroom to allow time for active learning, and the content that was
removed is delivered to students via on-line video. This approach ‘flips’ the traditional use of
lecture and more active learning approaches. Lecture occurs outside of class, and more active
learning, such as problem solving, happens during class. Assessment data was collected to
examine students’ use of the video lectures and perceptions of the classroom flip. The students’
feedback suggests that while the active learning and additional project time available in class
improved their understanding, they would prefer that only about half the classes be flipped and
some use of traditional lectures should be maintained.},

	abstract = {Flipped classrooms have the potential to improve student learning and metacognitive skills as a result of increased time for active learning and group work and student control over pacing, when compared with traditional lecture-based courses. We are currently running a 4-year controlled study to examine the impact of flipping an Introductory Differential Equations course at Harvey Mudd College. In particular, we compare flipped instruction with an interactive lecture with elements of active learning rather than a traditional lecture. The first two years of this study showed no differences in learning, metacognitive, or affective gains between the control and flipped sections. We believe that contextual factors, such as a strong group-work culture at Harvey Mudd College, contribute to the similar performance of both sections. Additionally, to maintain a rigorous experimental design, we maintained identical content across the control and flipped section; relaxing this requirement in a non-study setting would allow us to take further advantage of educational opportunities afforded by flipping, and may therefore improve student learning.},

For the meaning directed, reproduction directed and application directed learning style, no positive association with academic success could be detected. The undirected learning style, however, appeared to be a consistent negative predictor. For the Big Five personality factors (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience), a consistent, positive association for conscientiousness with academic success was found. The very first examination at the university came out as the most important predictor for academic success, even after two and three years of study.

It focuses on ways previous scholarship framed AAPIs in higher education, and specifically on how those works engaged in a sustained project of countering the model minority myth (MMM). Many publications on AAPIs in higher education mentioned the MMM and neglected to account for the original purpose of the MMM—to maintain anti-Black racism and White supremacy. We identified four key and interconnected limitations implicit in the counter-MMM framework that result from a lack of a critical recognition of the model minority as an instrument to maintain White dominance. Our analysis suggests that the well-established counter-MMM scholarly project is fundamentally flawed in its ability to humanistically reframe and advance research on AAPIs. Therefore, we call for a reframing of research on AAPIs in higher education.},

Aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between self-efficacy and academic achievement in high school students.
Method
In this study, 250 students in the academic year 2010/2011 were selected by means of multistage cluster sampling and completed self-efficacy scale. To measure achievement score grade point average in classes was used. To analyze data correlation coefficient and regression analysis was used.
Results
analysis of data revealed that self-evaluation, selfdirecting and self-regulation are correlated with academic achievement. Among all variables entered in the equation model only self-evaluation and self-regulation entered the regression model explaining 10 percent variance of academic achievement in 2 steps.
Conclusion
according to the results, self-efficacy is a considerable factor in academic achievement.},

	abstract = {Perceived self-efficacy, motivation, and the presence of mentors and role models have value as predictors of career choice and student success. To understand these constructs within the domain of construction education, a quantitative survey was administered to students enrolled in construction management courses (n = 468) at two large universities. Study results revealed that mean perceived self-efficacy toward construction education was significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) higher for construction management (CM) students who report having a role model. Further, CM students who report having a mentor reported a higher mean level of motivation to successfully complete construction education programs and courses (p = 0.015). Differences in self-efficacy and motivation toward construction education between male (n = 410) and female (n = 56) students suggest that female CM students have higher motivation towards construction education (p = 0.024) than their male counterparts. However, due to unequal gender distribution in the sample, coupled with violations of t test assumptions, gender-based findings should be interpreted with caution. This study indicates that students who report having a mentor or role model have higher self-efficacy and motivation toward construction education compared to students without a mentor or role model. The instrument adapted and utilized in the current study can be used to investigate these pertinent construction education-domain specific constructs in order to understand the influence of others on students' academic decisions and performance.},

I draw on the work of Gloria Anzaldúa, specifically her concepts of “conocimiento” and “Nepantla” to bring a more holistic/connected perspective to the “knowledge” teachers may need for teaching and highlight how it might align with broader definitions of mathematics. I also offer examples from a partnership with a Chicago high school to show how pre-service teachers move through cycles of knowledge construction.

This research investigates factors affecting undergraduate radiation physics students’ ability to self-assess their work accurately in a mathematical subject test. The factors investigated are demographics, mathematics confidence, prior mathematical attainment and prior level of mathematical knowledge. Students’ accuracy of their self-assessment was found to be associated with their prior mathematical attainment and their overall mathematics confidence. Students with high and low prior mathematical attainment self-assessed more accurately than students who had moderate prior attainment. These results have implications for how students may determine their own learning strategies and the pedagogical use of summative self-assessments.},

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is a well-recognized learning mode that enables effective practice and interactions among teachers and students in the class by switching the in-class instructional time and out-of-class practicing time. However, owing to their lack of self-regulated competence, most students might fail to browse and comprehend the instructional materials out of class by themselves. In this paper, a self-regulated flipped classroom approach is proposed to help students schedule their out-of-class time to effectively read and comprehend the learning content before class, such that they are capable of interacting with their peers and teachers in class for in-depth discussions. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experimental design was employed in an elementary school Mathematics course. The experimental group students learned with the self-regulated flipped classroom approach, while the control group students learned with the conventional flipped classroom approach. The study was conducted using a quantitative approach. The instruments used were a performance test, and questionnaires of self-efficacy and self-regulation. The experimental results indicated that the post-test score of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group. It was also found that the higher self-regulation students showed significantly different learning achievements when learning with different approaches, while there was no significant difference between lower self-regulation students with the different learning approaches. Moreover, the experimental group showed significantly higher self-efficacy than the control group. In addition, the learning log analysis results further showed that, conforming to the objective of the self-regulated strategy, the students would determine the goals for the next learning phase based on their current performance. To sum up, the findings of this study indicate that integrating the self-regulated strategy into flipped learning can improve students’ self-efficacy as well as their strategies of planning and using study time, and hence they can learn effectively and have better learning achievements.},

The computerized scripts provided a sequence of guidance for structuring intragroup and intergroup interactions and prompting individual metacognitive processes throughout the collaborative design phases based on the Think-Pair-Share method. Four intact classes of 80 fifth-grade students participated in this study. Employing a nonequivalent comparison group quasi-experimental design, this study examined whether or not applying the scripts better enhanced self-regulation and achievement in a technology-infused mathematics learning classroom. Multivariate analyses were conducted to reveal the effects on the aspects among the two sets of variables. The results showed medium effects on the controlling of metacognitive self-regulation and higher level achievement, whereas no significant effects were found for the planning aspect and lower level achievement between the groups with and without the collaboration scripts.

For both self-reported metacognitive self-regulation and regulation of cognition during problem solving, students profiled as rational had the highest self-reported mean and actual frequency of regulation of cognition compared to students profiled as predominantly empirical. Moreover, students profiled as predominantly rational correctly solved more problems than the other two groups.

	url = {https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED445631},
	abstract = {This study addressed the question: "What instructional techniques are most effective in helping students learn how to self-regulate their learning?" An integrated model based on current research in self-regulated learning (SRL) was used to explain changes in students' SRL. Five key instructional practices were identified and embedded into a math curriculum: (1) guide self-beliefs, goal setting, and expectations; (2) promote reflective dialogue; (3) provide corrective feedback; (4) connect abstract concepts; and (5) link to new experiences. Data were collected from 78 students attending a New England community college. Analysis of variance, correlations, and path analyses were used to determine differences between the treatment and comparison groups' perceptions of their SRL pre-  to post-semester. The results suggest that students who learned through SRL-embedded teaching methods became more effective in SRL, a finding that emphasizes the critical role that instructors play in the SRL process by providing cues within the instructional setting. The results also indicate that SRL is an integrated process. The paper suggests that future research in SRL should focus on methods that capture the interrelationship among the SRL variables.

	abstract = {In order to improve teaching strategies in a college level remedial mathematics course, this study seeks to investigate student perception while they attempt challenging mathematics tasks. The participants were 72 students enrolled in a mid-western university remedial mathematics course. A qualitative case study methodology was used to investigate the students' experience. The On-Line Motivational Questionnaire (OMQ) was used to gather general information about the group and to help the researcher determine the five individuals to be interviewed. The findings of the study showed that students persisted less often, were less accurate in their solutions, and protected their well being when confronted with a challenging mathematics task. The mathematics tasks required the students to use proportional thinking and the study suggests that the participants were not as accurate when comparing ratios symbolically. The findings suggest that curriculum should include more problem solving strategies and should specifically focus on proportional reasoning.

This is contrary to the non-negative attitude–achievement relationship frequently found at the student within-country level. Using attitudinal outcome mathematics self-concept, the afore-mentioned attitude–achievement paradox is hypothesized to stem from the incomparable student responses to Likert-type response scale of the attitude items. In this study, anchoring vignettes are used to examine whether it is feasible to tackle the effect of response style so as to improve the comparability of the self-concept measures across cultures and societies. Empirical evidences from PISA 2012 demonstrate that the paradox can be resolved satisfactorily, so that the attitude–achievement relationships at both student within-country and country levels are now in line with that predicted by contemporary self-concept theories in the literature. Using the anchored self-concept measure, Singapore’s and Shanghai-China’s 15-year-olds are found to perform pretty well cognitively and affectively in PISA 2012.},

The eight classroom environmental factors were categorised into three groups according to the nature and extent of their effects on students' affect in mathematics learning. Although most classroom environmental factors had a positive impact on college students' emotional experiences and values in the study of mathematics, the effects of two environmental factors, "the difficulty of studying mathematics" and "teacher support," were of particular interest. Given these results, instructors are encouraged to leave more room for student autonomy, to adopt some innovative learning approaches to promote student collaboration and to pay close attention to the difficulty of the mathematics curricula and competition among students.},

	abstract = {Most students, perhaps over 90 percent, can master what teachers have to teach them, and it is the task of instruction to find the means which will enable students to master the subject under consideration. A basic task is to determine what is meant by mastery of the subject and to search for methods and materials which will enable the largest proportion of students to attain such mastery. That is, the basic task in education is to find strategies which will take individual differences into consideration but in such a way as to promote the fullest development of the individual. The thesis of this paper is that, to promote mastery learning, 5 variables must be dealt with effectively: (1) aptitude for kinds of learning, viewed as the amount of time required by the learner to attain  mastery of the task; (2) quality of instruction, viewed in terms of its approaching the optimum for a given learner; (3) ability to understand instruction, i.e., to understand the nature of the task and the procedures to follow; (4) perseverance, the amount of time one is willing to spend in learning; and (5) time allowed for learning, the key to mastery.

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine which academic and affective student factors were significant to student success in a mastery learning program in developmental mathematics and to determine if the mastery learning program led to increased mathematical knowledge retention and success in the subsequent math course. The first phase of the study involved 298 students in developmental mathematics. Using binary logistic regression, the researcher found that placement test score, previous experience with mastery learning, and gender were statistically significant factors related to student success in the mastery learning program. The second phase of the study involved 529 students in the subsequent course intermediate algebra. Using one-way analysis of variance and chi-square methods, the researcher found that mastery learning students retained significantly more mathematical content knowledge and succeeded at significantly higher rates in the subsequent course intermediate algebra as compared to students who took developmental mathematics through traditional methods and those who opted out of placement testing. Results of the study showed that the mastery learning approach in developmental mathematics which incorporated the affective student domain offered advantages for assisting students to overcome math background and self-efficacy barriers.

No study to date has measured physicians’ unconscious racial bias to test whether this predicts physicians’ clinical decisions.ObjectiveTo test whether physicians show implicit race bias and whether the magnitude of such bias predicts thrombolysis recommendations for black and white patients with acute coronary syndromes.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsAn internet-based tool comprising a clinical vignette of a patient presenting to the emergency department with an acute coronary syndrome, followed by a questionnaire and three Implicit Association Tests (IATs). Study invitations were e-mailed to all internal medicine and emergency medicine residents at four academic medical centers in Atlanta and Boston; 287 completed the study, met inclusion criteria, and were randomized to either a black or white vignette patient.Main Outcome MeasuresIAT scores (normal continuous variable) measuring physicians’ implicit race preference and perceptions of cooperativeness. Physicians’ attribution of symptoms to coronary artery disease for vignette patients with randomly assigned race, and their decisions about thrombolysis. Assessment of physicians’ explicit racial biases by questionnaire.ResultsPhysicians reported no explicit preference for white versus black patients or differences in perceived cooperativeness. In contrast, IATs revealed implicit preference favoring white Americans (mean IAT score = 0.36, P {\textless} .001, one-sample t test) and implicit stereotypes of black Americans as less cooperative with medical procedures (mean IAT score 0.22, P {\textless} .001), and less cooperative generally (mean IAT score 0.30, P {\textless} .001). As physicians’ prowhite implicit bias increased, so did their likelihood of treating white patients and not treating black patients with thrombolysis (P = .009).ConclusionsThis study represents the first evidence of unconscious (implicit) race bias among physicians, its dissociation from conscious (explicit) bias, and its predictive validity. Results suggest that physicians’ unconscious biases may contribute to racial/ethnic disparities in use of medical procedures such as thrombolysis for myocardial infarction.},

Reflecting the pressure of this vulnerability, Blacks underperformed in relation to Whites in the ability-diagnostic condition but not in the nondiagnostic condition (with Scholastic Aptitude Tests controlled). Study 3 validated that ability-diagnosticity cognitively activated the racial stereotype in these participants and motivated them not to conform to it, or to be judged by it.

	abstract = {Objectives: An apparent increase in seriously disturbed students consulting student health services in the UK has led to concern that increasing financial difficulties and other outside pressures may affect student mental health and academic performance. The current research investigated whether student anxiety and depression increases after college entry, the extent to which adverse life experiences contribute to any increases, and the impact of adversity, anxiety and depression on exam performance. Method: 351 UK-domiciled undergraduates completed questionnaires one month before university entry and mid-course. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS: Zigmond \& Snaith, 1983) was administered at both time points and a modified List of Threatening Experiences (Brugha, Bebbington, Tennant, \& Hurry, 1985) was administered mid-course. Results: By mid-course 9\% of previously symptom-free students became depressed and 20\% became anxious at a clinically significant level. Of those previously anxious or depressed 36\% had recovered. After adjusting for pre-entry symptoms, financial difficulties made a significant independent contribution to depression and relationship difficulties independently predicted anxiety. Depression and financial difficulties mid-course predicted a decrease in exam performance from first to second year. Conclusions: This is the first study to confirm empirically that financial and other difficulties can increase British students' levels of anxiety and depression and that financial difficulties and depression can affect academic performance. However, university life may also have a beneficial effect for some students with pre-existing conditions. With widening participation in higher education, the results have important implications for educational and health policies.},

The achievement scale of the Multidimensional Multi‐attributional Scale Causality (MMCS) was used to measure locus of control, and the Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale to assess students’ self esteem. The study sample consisted of 675 (202 males and 473 females) second‐year undergraduate students. The results indicated that examination and examination results were the highest causes of stress in students, followed by studying for exams, too much to do and the amount to learn, respectively. Results showed that 77.6\% and 10.4\% of the students fall into the moderate and serious stress categories, respectively, and that there were significant differences between females and males students in both academic and life stress, with female students more stressed than males. Results also indicated a significant positive correlation between locus of control and academic stress, suggesting that students with external beliefs are more stressed than those with internal. A significant negative correlation between self esteem and both academic and life stress emerged, indicating that students with high self esteem are less stressed than are those with low.},

	abstract = {The school-to-prison pipeline (STPP) is a commonly used metaphor that was developed to describe the many ways in which schools have become a conduit to the juvenile and criminal justice systems. The STPP metaphor encompasses various disciplinary policies and practices that label students as troublemakers, exclude students from school, and increase their likelihood of involvement in delinquency, juvenile justice, and subsequent incarceration. Many external forces promote these policies and practices, including high-stakes testing, harsh justice system practices and penal policies, and federal laws that promote the referral of certain school offenses to law enforcement. Empirical research confirms some of the pathways posited by STPP. For example, research has shown that out-of-school suspensions predict school dropout, justice system involvement and adult incarceration. However, research on some of the posited links, such as the impact of school-based arrests and referrals to court on school dropout, is lacking.Despite gaps in the empirical literature and some theoretical shortcomings, the term has gained widespread acceptance in both academic and political circles. A conference held at Northeastern University in 2003 yielded the first published use of the phrase. Soon, it attained widespread prominence, as various media outlets as well as civil rights and education organizations (e.g., ACLU, the Advancement Project (they also use “schoolhouse-to-jailhouse track”), the National Education Association (NEA), and the American Federation of Teachers) referenced the term in their initiatives. More recently, the Obama administration used the phrase in their federal school disciplinary reform efforts. Despite its widespread use, the utility of STPP as a social scientific concept and model is open for debate.Whereas some social scientists and activists have employed STPP to highlight how even non-criminal justice institutions can contribute to over-incarceration, other scholars are critical of the concept. Some scholars feel that the pipeline metaphor is too narrow and posits an overly purposeful or mechanistic link between schools and prisons; in fact, there is a much more complicated relationship that includes multiple stakeholders that fail our nation’s youth. Rather than viewing school policies and practices in isolation, critical scholars have argued that school processes of criminalization and exclusion are inextricably linked to poverty, unemployment, and the weaknesses of the child welfare and mental health systems. In short, the metaphor does not properly capture the web of institutional forces and missed opportunities that can push youth toward harmful choices and circumstances, often resulting in incarceration. Many reforms across the nation seek to dismantle STPP, including non-exclusionary discipline alternatives such as restorative justice and limiting the role of school police officers. Rigorous research on their effectiveness is needed.},

	abstract = {In this investigation, we evaluated the effectiveness of a self-monitoring package with 3 learning disabled students whose responding to subtraction problems had been highly inconsistent and unsuccessful. Following a two-phase baseline of didactic instruction and special incentives, an error analysis was used to develop individualized self-monitoring checklists that the students then responded to as they completed their subtraction assignments. In the context of a multiple baseline design, the self-monitoring procedures produced immediate gains in correct responding, with more stable levels of successful performance occurring across sessions. In a subsequent maintenance phase, the checklists were removed and the previous incentives condition was reinstated, resulting in continued levels of successful responding. The results are compared to the literature on self-monitoring and learning disabilities and discussed in terms of the continuing need for effective and efficient instructional strategies.},

	abstract = {This chapter elucidates the importance and centrality of self-regulation in the context of the prevailing new conception of school mathematics as a major objective of mathematics education and as a crucial characteristic of effective mathematics learning. However, this importance contrasts sharply with the many observations that demonstrate that students of different ages show serious shortcomings in various self-regulatory aspects of a mathematical disposition, more specifically, in their metacognitive and metavolitional skills. In addition, they are affected by naive and incorrect beliefs about mathematics, mathematics learning, and problem solving that are not conducive to the development of self-regulation skills. Evidence shows these weaknesses should not necessarily occur and develop in students, and that if they do, they probably can be remedied. Indeed, a series of design experiments, in which new research based learning environments are implemented in real classrooms indicate that such interventions can have significant favorable effects on students' cognitive self-regulation skills, as well as on their mathematics related beliefs. A comparison of the instructional models that underlie the interventions in those experiments leads one to the identification of a rather coherent set of principles for the design of powerful learning environments. These principles relate to the nature of the tasks and problems presented to the pupils, the kinds of powerful instructional activities embedded in the learning environment, and the sociomathematical norms that determine the classroom culture and climate.},

	abstract = {Racial segregation is often blamed for some of the achievement gap between blacks and whites. We study the effects of school and neighborhood segregation on the relative SAT scores of black students across different metropolitan areas, using large microdata samples for the 1998–2001 test cohorts. Our models include detailed controls for the family background of individual test-takers, school-level controls for selective participation in the test, and city-level controls for racial composition, income, and region. We find robust evidence that the black–white test score gap is higher in more segregated cities. Holding constant family background and other factors, a shift from a highly segregated city to a nearly integrated city closes about one-quarter of the raw black–white gap in SAT scores. Specifications that distinguish between school and neighborhood segregation suggest that neighborhood segregation has a consistently negative impact while school segregation has no independent effect, though we cannot reject equality of the two effects. Additional tests indicate that much of the effect of neighborhood segregation operates through neighbors' incomes, not through race per se. Data on enrollment in honors courses suggest that within-school segregation increases when schools are more highly integrated, potentially offsetting the benefits of school desegregation and accounting for our findings.},
