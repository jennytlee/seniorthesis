	abstract = {Higher education institutions have taken to redesigning high-enrollment, introductory courses to improve student learning outcomes, student success, and degree completion. This paper presents findings from the assessment of course redesign by focusing on the case of developmental math at a large community college. The college adopted modularization, a common course redesign method in which concepts are disaggregated into modules and delivered through computer software. Preliminary results from the quantitative analysis of student performance in redesigned courses have been mixed. The study discusses faculty and student views and experiences with modular math redesign in order to complement and help illuminate the results from the quantitative analysis. Using evidence from five focus groups, one with faculty and four with students, the paper provides insights on how to help faculty and students ease into their new roles and reshape those roles for an enhanced, more engaging, and more effective teaching and learning experience.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to determine which academic and affective student factors were significant to student success in a mastery learning program in developmental mathematics and to determine if the mastery learning program led to increased mathematical knowledge retention and success in the subsequent math course. The first phase of the study involved 298 students in developmental mathematics. Using binary logistic regression, the researcher found that placement test score, previous experience with mastery learning, and gender were statistically significant factors related to student success in the mastery learning program. The second phase of the study involved 529 students in the subsequent course intermediate algebra. Using one-way analysis of variance and chi-square methods, the researcher found that mastery learning students retained significantly more mathematical content knowledge and succeeded at significantly higher rates in the subsequent course intermediate algebra as compared to students who took developmental mathematics through traditional methods and those who opted out of placement testing. Results of the study showed that the mastery learning approach in developmental mathematics which incorporated the affective student domain offered advantages for assisting students to overcome math background and self-efficacy barriers.

That is, the basic task in education is to find strategies which will take individual differences into consideration but in such a way as to promote the fullest development of the individual. The thesis of this paper is that, to promote mastery learning, 5 variables must be dealt with effectively: (1) aptitude for kinds of learning, viewed as the amount of time required by the learner to attain  mastery of the task; (2) quality of instruction, viewed in terms of its approaching the optimum for a given learner; (3) ability to understand instruction, i.e., to understand the nature of the task and the procedures to follow; (4) perseverance, the amount of time one is willing to spend in learning; and (5) time allowed for learning, the key to mastery.

A total of 2529 students responded to three measures that were specifically designed to assess college students' perceptions of the mathematics classroom environment, their emotional experiences and values of studying mathematics. Comparatively, the students had a higher score on the value of mathematics but lower scores on their emotional experiences of mathematics learning, and the characteristics of the classroom environment had some significant effects on the students' emotional experiences and values of studying mathematics. The eight classroom environmental factors were categorised into three groups according to the nature and extent of their effects on students' affect in mathematics learning. Although most classroom environmental factors had a positive impact on college students' emotional experiences and values in the study of mathematics, the effects of two environmental factors, "the difficulty of studying mathematics" and "teacher support," were of particular interest. Given these results, instructors are encouraged to leave more room for student autonomy, to adopt some innovative learning approaches to promote student collaboration and to pay close attention to the difficulty of the mathematics curricula and competition among students.},

After, through student responses on a self-report survey, we compared the group of underachievers to a group of achievers ( n=36) on their self-efficacy and its sources. Both quantitative and qualitative results underscored the importance of mastery experiences for underachievers. The underachievers had significantly less mastery experiences and verbal persuasions despite having similar levels of self-efficacy. Implications for how to cultivate mastery and to provide efficacy-supportive feedback as well as psychological mechanisms regarding high potential underachievers are discussed.},

This is contrary to the non-negative attitude–achievement relationship frequently found at the student within-country level. Using attitudinal outcome mathematics self-concept, the afore-mentioned attitude–achievement paradox is hypothesized to stem from the incomparable student responses to Likert-type response scale of the attitude items. In this study, anchoring vignettes are used to examine whether it is feasible to tackle the effect of response style so as to improve the comparability of the self-concept measures across cultures and societies. Empirical evidences from PISA 2012 demonstrate that the paradox can be resolved satisfactorily, so that the attitude–achievement relationships at both student within-country and country levels are now in line with that predicted by contemporary self-concept theories in the literature. Using the anchored self-concept measure, Singapore’s and Shanghai-China’s 15-year-olds are found to perform pretty well cognitively and affectively in PISA 2012.},

The On-Line Motivational Questionnaire (OMQ) was used to gather general information about the group and to help the researcher determine the five individuals to be interviewed. The findings of the study showed that students persisted less often, were less accurate in their solutions, and protected their well being when confronted with a challenging mathematics task. The mathematics tasks required the students to use proportional thinking and the study suggests that the participants were not as accurate when comparing ratios symbolically. The findings suggest that curriculum should include more problem solving strategies and should specifically focus on proportional reasoning.

	url = {https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED445631},
	abstract = {This study addressed the question: "What instructional techniques are most effective in helping students learn how to self-regulate their learning?" An integrated model based on current research in self-regulated learning (SRL) was used to explain changes in students' SRL. Five key instructional practices were identified and embedded into a math curriculum: (1) guide self-beliefs, goal setting, and expectations; (2) promote reflective dialogue; (3) provide corrective feedback; (4) connect abstract concepts; and (5) link to new experiences. Data were collected from 78 students attending a New England community college. Analysis of variance, correlations, and path analyses were used to determine differences between the treatment and comparison groups' perceptions of their SRL pre-  to post-semester. The results suggest that students who learned through SRL-embedded teaching methods became more effective in SRL, a finding that emphasizes the critical role that instructors play in the SRL process by providing cues within the instructional setting. The results also indicate that SRL is an integrated process. The paper suggests that future research in SRL should focus on methods that capture the interrelationship among the SRL variables.

Episodes were coded for planning, monitoring, control, use of empirical and rational argumentation, and justification for solutions. For both self-reported metacognitive self-regulation and regulation of cognition during problem solving, students profiled as rational had the highest self-reported mean and actual frequency of regulation of cognition compared to students profiled as predominantly empirical. Moreover, students profiled as predominantly rational correctly solved more problems than the other two groups. Finally, students’ approaches to problem solving were consistent with their epistemic profiles. Relations are discussed in the context of various theoretical frameworks.},

Multivariate analyses were conducted to reveal the effects on the aspects among the two sets of variables. The results showed medium effects on the controlling of metacognitive self-regulation and higher level achievement, whereas no significant effects were found for the planning aspect and lower level achievement between the groups with and without the collaboration scripts.

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is a well-recognized learning mode that enables effective practice and interactions among teachers and students in the class by switching the in-class instructional time and out-of-class practicing time. However, owing to their lack of self-regulated competence, most students might fail to browse and comprehend the instructional materials out of class by themselves. In this paper, a self-regulated flipped classroom approach is proposed to help students schedule their out-of-class time to effectively read and comprehend the learning content before class, such that they are capable of interacting with their peers and teachers in class for in-depth discussions. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experimental design was employed in an elementary school Mathematics course. The experimental group students learned with the self-regulated flipped classroom approach, while the control group students learned with the conventional flipped classroom approach. The study was conducted using a quantitative approach. The instruments used were a performance test, and questionnaires of self-efficacy and self-regulation. The experimental results indicated that the post-test score of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group. It was also found that the higher self-regulation students showed significantly different learning achievements when learning with different approaches, while there was no significant difference between lower self-regulation students with the different learning approaches. Moreover, the experimental group showed significantly higher self-efficacy than the control group. In addition, the learning log analysis results further showed that, conforming to the objective of the self-regulated strategy, the students would determine the goals for the next learning phase based on their current performance. To sum up, the findings of this study indicate that integrating the self-regulated strategy into flipped learning can improve students’ self-efficacy as well as their strategies of planning and using study time, and hence they can learn effectively and have better learning achievements.},

I draw on the work of Gloria Anzaldúa, specifically her concepts of “conocimiento” and “Nepantla” to bring a more holistic/connected perspective to the “knowledge” teachers may need for teaching and highlight how it might align with broader definitions of mathematics. I also offer examples from a partnership with a Chicago high school to show how pre-service teachers move through cycles of knowledge construction.

	abstract = {Perceived self-efficacy, motivation, and the presence of mentors and role models have value as predictors of career choice and student success. To understand these constructs within the domain of construction education, a quantitative survey was administered to students enrolled in construction management courses (n = 468) at two large universities. Study results revealed that mean perceived self-efficacy toward construction education was significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) higher for construction management (CM) students who report having a role model. Further, CM students who report having a mentor reported a higher mean level of motivation to successfully complete construction education programs and courses (p = 0.015). Differences in self-efficacy and motivation toward construction education between male (n = 410) and female (n = 56) students suggest that female CM students have higher motivation towards construction education (p = 0.024) than their male counterparts. However, due to unequal gender distribution in the sample, coupled with violations of t test assumptions, gender-based findings should be interpreted with caution. This study indicates that students who report having a mentor or role model have higher self-efficacy and motivation toward construction education compared to students without a mentor or role model. The instrument adapted and utilized in the current study can be used to investigate these pertinent construction education-domain specific constructs in order to understand the influence of others on students' academic decisions and performance.},

It focuses on ways previous scholarship framed AAPIs in higher education, and specifically on how those works engaged in a sustained project of countering the model minority myth (MMM). Many publications on AAPIs in higher education mentioned the MMM and neglected to account for the original purpose of the MMM—to maintain anti-Black racism and White supremacy. We identified four key and interconnected limitations implicit in the counter-MMM framework that result from a lack of a critical recognition of the model minority as an instrument to maintain White dominance. Our analysis suggests that the well-established counter-MMM scholarly project is fundamentally flawed in its ability to humanistically reframe and advance research on AAPIs. Therefore, we call for a reframing of research on AAPIs in higher education.},

	abstract = {This study is directed towards an integration of intellectual ability, learning style, personality and achievement motivation as predictors of academic success in higher education. Correlational analyses partly confirmed and partly disconfirmed our expectations in a sample of 409 first-year psychology students. Consistent with the literature, intellectual ability and achievement motivation were associated positively with academic success. For the meaning directed, reproduction directed and application directed learning style, no positive association with academic success could be detected. The undirected learning style, however, appeared to be a consistent negative predictor. For the Big Five personality factors (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience), a consistent, positive association for conscientiousness with academic success was found. The very first examination at the university came out as the most important predictor for academic success, even after two and three years of study. The implications of the results are discussed in relation to the literature and the policy of the Dutch Ministry of Education.},
