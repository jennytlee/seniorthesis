	abstract = {Secondary data analyses of large-scale international student assessment at the country level often reveal that educational systems which are high in academic achievement are found low in attitudinal outcomes of schooling, and vice versa. This is contrary to the non-negative attitude–achievement relationship frequently found at the student within-country level. Using attitudinal outcome mathematics self-concept, the afore-mentioned attitude–achievement paradox is hypothesized to stem from the incomparable student responses to Likert-type response scale of the attitude items. In this study, anchoring vignettes are used to examine whether it is feasible to tackle the effect of response style so as to improve the comparability of the self-concept measures across cultures and societies. Empirical evidences from {PISA} 2012 demonstrate that the paradox can be resolved satisfactorily, so that the attitude–achievement relationships at both student within-country and country levels are now in line with that predicted by contemporary self-concept theories in the literature. Using the anchored self-concept measure, Singapore’s and Shanghai-China’s 15-year-olds are found to perform pretty well cognitively and affectively in {PISA} 2012.},

We conducted analyses for both the complete sample and an at-risk group of low performing students who overestimate their skills. Self-evaluative standards had no effect on calibration accuracy and performance. Students who received feedback were more accurate in their self-evaluative judgements than students who received neither type of feedback. In overconfident students, feedback additionally increased prediction accuracy and, albeit marginally, performance. We discuss the educational implications of our findings with respect to the relevance of standards and feedback for promoting self-regulated learning within regular classroom settings.},

Students' responses to open-ended prompts were coded according to Bandura's (Self-efficacy: the exercise of control, W.H. Freeman, New York, 1997) four hypothesized sources of self-efficacy and an additional emergent theme of self-regulated learning. After, through student responses on a self-report survey, we compared the group of underachievers to a group of achievers ( n=36) on their self-efficacy and its sources. Both quantitative and qualitative results underscored the importance of mastery experiences for underachievers. The underachievers had significantly less mastery experiences and verbal persuasions despite having similar levels of self-efficacy. Implications for how to cultivate mastery and to provide efficacy-supportive feedback as well as psychological mechanisms regarding high potential underachievers are discussed.},

A total of 2529 students responded to three measures that were specifically designed to assess college students' perceptions of the mathematics classroom environment, their emotional experiences and values of studying mathematics. Comparatively, the students had a higher score on the value of mathematics but lower scores on their emotional experiences of mathematics learning, and the characteristics of the classroom environment had some significant effects on the students' emotional experiences and values of studying mathematics. The eight classroom environmental factors were categorised into three groups according to the nature and extent of their effects on students' affect in mathematics learning. Although most classroom environmental factors had a positive impact on college students' emotional experiences and values in the study of mathematics, the effects of two environmental factors, "the difficulty of studying mathematics" and "teacher support," were of particular interest. Given these results, instructors are encouraged to leave more room for student autonomy, to adopt some innovative learning approaches to promote student collaboration and to pay close attention to the difficulty of the mathematics curricula and competition among students.},

That is, the basic task in education is to find strategies which will take individual differences into consideration but in such a way as to promote the fullest development of the individual. The thesis of this paper is that, to promote mastery learning, 5 variables must be dealt with effectively: (1) aptitude for kinds of learning, viewed as the amount of time required by the learner to attain  mastery of the task; (2) quality of instruction, viewed in terms of its approaching the optimum for a given learner; (3) ability to understand instruction, i.e., to understand the nature of the task and the procedures to follow; (4) perseverance, the amount of time one is willing to spend in learning; and (5) time allowed for learning, the key to mastery.

The first phase of the study involved 298 students in developmental mathematics. Using binary logistic regression, the researcher found that placement test score, previous experience with mastery learning, and gender were statistically significant factors related to student success in the mastery learning program. The second phase of the study involved 529 students in the subsequent course intermediate algebra. Using one-way analysis of variance and chi-square methods, the researcher found that mastery learning students retained significantly more mathematical content knowledge and succeeded at significantly higher rates in the subsequent course intermediate algebra as compared to students who took developmental mathematics through traditional methods and those who opted out of placement testing. Results of the study showed that the mastery learning approach in developmental mathematics which incorporated the affective student domain offered advantages for assisting students to overcome math background and self-efficacy barriers.

	abstract = {In order to improve teaching strategies in a college level remedial mathematics course, this study seeks to investigate student perception while they attempt challenging mathematics tasks. The participants were 72 students enrolled in a mid-western university remedial mathematics course. A qualitative case study methodology was used to investigate the students' experience. The On-Line Motivational Questionnaire ({OMQ}) was used to gather general information about the group and to help the researcher determine the five individuals to be interviewed. The findings of the study showed that students persisted less often, were less accurate in their solutions, and protected their well being when confronted with a challenging mathematics task. The mathematics tasks required the students to use proportional thinking and the study suggests that the participants were not as accurate when comparing ratios symbolically. The findings suggest that curriculum should include more problem solving strategies and should specifically focus on proportional reasoning.

	abstract = {This study addressed the question: "What instructional techniques are most effective in helping students learn how to self-regulate their learning?" An integrated model based on current research in self-regulated learning ({SRL}) was used to explain changes in students' {SRL}. Five key instructional practices were identified and embedded into a math curriculum: (1) guide self-beliefs, goal setting, and expectations; (2) promote reflective dialogue; (3) provide corrective feedback; (4) connect abstract concepts; and (5) link to new experiences. Data were collected from 78 students attending a New England community college. Analysis of variance, correlations, and path analyses were used to determine differences between the treatment and comparison groups' perceptions of their {SRL} pre-  to post-semester. The results suggest that students who learned through {SRL}-embedded teaching methods became more effective in {SRL}, a finding that emphasizes the critical role that instructors play in the {SRL} process by providing cues within the instructional setting. The results also indicate that {SRL} is an integrated process. The paper suggests that future research in {SRL} should focus on methods that capture the interrelationship among the {SRL} variables.

The subscales for the motivation scale are intrinsic goal orientation, extrinsic goal orientation, task value, control of learning beliefs, self-efficacy for learning and performance, and test anxiety; while the subscales for the learning strategies scale are rehearsal, elaboration, organization, critical thinking, metacognitive self-regulation, time and study environment management, effort regulation, peer learning, and help-seeking. The study group was comprised of 183 college students. It was determined that college students' test anxiety and self-efficacy for learning and performance are significant predictors of college students' mathematics anxiety. In addition, college students' rehearsal and elaboration of cognitive learning strategies were found to be significant predictors for their mathematics anxiety.

Episodes were coded for planning, monitoring, control, use of empirical and rational argumentation, and justification for solutions. For both self-reported metacognitive self-regulation and regulation of cognition during problem solving, students profiled as rational had the highest self-reported mean and actual frequency of regulation of cognition compared to students profiled as predominantly empirical. Moreover, students profiled as predominantly rational correctly solved more problems than the other two groups.

	abstract = {The flipped classroom is a well-recognized learning mode that enables effective practice and interactions among teachers and students in the class by switching the in-class instructional time and out-of-class practicing time. However, owing to their lack of self-regulated competence, most students might fail to browse and comprehend the instructional materials out of class by themselves. In this paper, a self-regulated flipped classroom approach is proposed to help students schedule their out-of-class time to effectively read and comprehend the learning content before class, such that they are capable of interacting with their peers and teachers in class for in-depth discussions. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a quasi-experimental design was employed in an elementary school Mathematics course. The experimental group students learned with the self-regulated flipped classroom approach, while the control group students learned with the conventional flipped classroom approach. The study was conducted using a quantitative approach. The instruments used were a performance test, and questionnaires of self-efficacy and self-regulation. The experimental results indicated that the post-test score of the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group. It was also found that the higher self-regulation students showed significantly different learning achievements when learning with different approaches, while there was no significant difference between lower self-regulation students with the different learning approaches. Moreover, the experimental group showed significantly higher self-efficacy than the control group. In addition, the learning log analysis results further showed that, conforming to the objective of the self-regulated strategy, the students would determine the goals for the next learning phase based on their current performance. To sum up, the findings of this study indicate that integrating the self-regulated strategy into flipped learning can improve students’ self-efficacy as well as their strategies of planning and using study time, and hence they can learn effectively and have better learning achievements.},

	abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics ({STEM}) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 {SDs} under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the {STEM} disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate {STEM} education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

@article{zappe_flipping_2009,
	title = {"Flipping" the classroom to explore active learning in a large undergraduate course},
	abstract = {In traditional approaches to teaching engineering classes, the instructor plays the role of
information conveyor, while the students assume a receiver role with primary responsibilities of
listening and note-taking. Research into how students learn suggests that students need to be
more actively engaged with the course material to maximize their understanding. The literature
contains many examples of active learning strategies, such as teams solving problems in class
and the use of student response systems with conceptual questions. Incorporating active learning
strategies into a class means that there will be less time for delivering material via lecture.
Therefore, instructors who choose to utilize active learning strategies must find ways to ensure
that all required course content is still addressed.

This paper discusses an instructional technique called the “classroom flip” model which was
assessed in a larger, undergraduate architectural engineering class. In this model, lecture content
is removed from the classroom to allow time for active learning, and the content that was
removed is delivered to students via on-line video. This approach ‘flips’ the traditional use of
lecture and more active learning approaches. Lecture occurs outside of class, and more active
learning, such as problem solving, happens during class. Assessment data was collected to
examine students’ use of the video lectures and perceptions of the classroom flip. The students’
feedback suggests that while the active learning and additional project time available in class
improved their understanding, they would prefer that only about half the classes be flipped and
some use of traditional lectures should be maintained.},

In particular, we compare flipped instruction with an interactive lecture with elements of active learning rather than a traditional lecture. The first two years of this study showed no differences in learning, metacognitive, or affective gains between the control and flipped sections. We believe that contextual factors, such as a strong group-work culture at Harvey Mudd College, contribute to the similar performance of both sections. Additionally, to maintain a rigorous experimental design, we maintained identical content across the control and flipped section; relaxing this requirement in a non-study setting would allow us to take further advantage of educational opportunities afforded by flipping, and may therefore improve student learning.},

Correlational analyses partly confirmed and partly disconfirmed our expectations in a sample of 409 first-year psychology students. Consistent with the literature, intellectual ability and achievement motivation were associated positively with academic success. For the meaning directed, reproduction directed and application directed learning style, no positive association with academic success could be detected. The undirected learning style, however, appeared to be a consistent negative predictor. For the Big Five personality factors (extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness to experience), a consistent, positive association for conscientiousness with academic success was found. The very first examination at the university came out as the most important predictor for academic success, even after two and three years of study. The implications of the results are discussed in relation to the literature and the policy of the Dutch Ministry of Education.},

Students at a small, regional college in the southeast were surveyed at the beginning and end of their first semester of enrollment. Researchers found no negative impact on students’ academic self-concept or self-efficacy as a result of enrollment in multiple developmental courses in the first semester, but students enrolled in multiple developmental courses had lower academic self-concept than peers. There was no difference between the groups for academic self-efficacy.},

This article describes intervention studies that use self-regulation strategies to improve mathematics performance of students with {LD} at the elementary, middle, and secondary school levels. Several techniques to facilitate effective implementation of self-regulation instruction in the classroom are presented.},

It focuses on ways previous scholarship framed {AAPIs} in higher education, and specifically on how those works engaged in a sustained project of countering the model minority myth ({MMM}). Many publications on {AAPIs} in higher education mentioned the {MMM} and neglected to account for the original purpose of the {MMM}—to maintain anti-Black racism and White supremacy. We identified four key and interconnected limitations implicit in the counter-{MMM} framework that result from a lack of a critical recognition of the model minority as an instrument to maintain White dominance. Our analysis suggests that the well-established counter-{MMM} scholarly project is fundamentally flawed in its ability to humanistically reframe and advance research on {AAPIs}. Therefore, we call for a reframing of research on {AAPIs} in higher education.},

Aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between self-efficacy and academic achievement in high school students.
Method
In this study, 250 students in the academic year 2010/2011 were selected by means of multistage cluster sampling and completed self-efficacy scale. To measure achievement score grade point average in classes was used. To analyze data correlation coefficient and regression analysis was used.
Results
analysis of data revealed that self-evaluation, selfdirecting and self-regulation are correlated with academic achievement. Among all variables entered in the equation model only self-evaluation and self-regulation entered the regression model explaining 10 percent variance of academic achievement in 2 steps.
Conclusion
according to the results, self-efficacy is a considerable factor in academic achievement.},

	abstract = {Perceived self-efficacy, motivation, and the presence of mentors and role models have value as predictors of career choice and student success. To understand these constructs within the domain of construction education, a quantitative survey was administered to students enrolled in construction management courses (n = 468) at two large universities. Study results revealed that mean perceived self-efficacy toward construction education was significantly (p {\textless} 0.001) higher for construction management ({CM}) students who report having a role model. Further, {CM} students who report having a mentor reported a higher mean level of motivation to successfully complete construction education programs and courses (p = 0.015). Differences in self-efficacy and motivation toward construction education between male (n = 410) and female (n = 56) students suggest that female {CM} students have higher motivation towards construction education (p = 0.024) than their male counterparts. However, due to unequal gender distribution in the sample, coupled with violations of t test assumptions, gender-based findings should be interpreted with caution. This study indicates that students who report having a mentor or role model have higher self-efficacy and motivation toward construction education compared to students without a mentor or role model. The instrument adapted and utilized in the current study can be used to investigate these pertinent construction education-domain specific constructs in order to understand the influence of others on students' academic decisions and performance.},

This paper begins with the idea that mathematics education has much to gain from perspectives in Latin@ studies. I draw on the work of Gloria Anzaldúa, specifically her concepts of “conocimiento” and “Nepantla” to bring a more holistic/connected perspective to the “knowledge” teachers may need for teaching and highlight how it might align with broader definitions of mathematics. I also offer examples from a partnership with a Chicago high school to show how pre-service teachers move through cycles of knowledge construction. Implications for teacher education, and teacher recruitment are discussed.},
