\section{The need for change}
I politely ask you to consider: a typical child grows up being told over and over again to ``be quiet'' and to learn the materials presented in front of them; there are no stupid questions as long as they are relevant to the material at hand. As they progress into higher education (if they do), they find themselves often sitting in a large lecture hall, questions left unanswered ``in the interest of time,'' and wondering whether the lecturer knows their name, or even cares if they show up at all.

A Google search for ``changing higher education'' returns a plethora of articles responding to recent student strikes advocating for change in policies regarding finances and other economic concerns. In contrast, a search for ``changing K-12 education'' returns a 20-page ERIC (Education Resources Information Center) document on curriculum reform and effect on entering post-secondary institutions. Despite advances in research in education, classroom instruction has not changed significantly in a typical college in the last five to ten decades, if not more. Students are still attending large lecture-style classes assessed via exams and weekly, graded assignments. With an increasing number of individuals pursuing a higher education, it seems naive to think that the current systems of education are still suitable or equitable to all students.

\section{Mathematics is not fair}
The current nature of mathematics education in the US provides an extremely different experience for a student who is Asian American versus African American versus white. Starting from achievement gaps between African American and Latino/a students and white students to  the extremely stereotypical belief that ``Asians are good at math,'' there is abundant evidence for the unfair nature of mathematics education (\cite{alfinio_flores_examining_2007}).

The 2007-2011 census provides enough quantitative evidence of the unequal distribution of poverty among different races. American Indians and African Americans came in the highest at about 26\% of the population being in poverty, more than a double in comparison to the 11.6\% of whites (\cite{macartney}). A recent New York Times article showcasing a megastudy done on black men showed that of the 5,000 white and 5,000 black boys who grew up in poverty, 48\% of black boys grew up to remain in poverty while only 2\% grew to be rich, compared to 31\% of white boys remaining in poverty and 10\% became rich (\cite{badger_extensive_2018}).

With income gaps this big, opportunity gaps are not very different. In 2013, postsecondary education enrollment percentages showed about a near 10\% gap between white (42\%) and black (34\%) students (\cite{musu-gillette_status_nodate}). Graduation rates were similar, lowest for black students at around 41\%. These numbers dip down further for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) degrees, about 11\%.

Exactly what perpetuates these depressing statistics rests deeply rooted in racism that has lined all of US history. To be more specific, it is absolute ignorance to think that any part of education is void of racism, whether intentional or not. From the 2005 study conducted by the American Mathematics Society, 80\% of full time mathematics professors with PhDs are white, compared to 1\% black and 2\% Hispanic.

Mathematics is historically not a unique subject to white Europeans; rather, prominent advancements were made by several individuals from all over world. Yet, if we ask ourselves the names of famous mathematicians, what we hear are not Srinivasa Ramanujan, Hypatia, or Dorothy Vaughn but rather Euler, Pythagoras and Fermat. The problem lies exactly here--whiteness is rarely questioned in this context of mathematics. Without having stood in the shadow of an individual that society pictures to be the ``model mathematician,'' it is extremely difficult to understand the place of inequality in the education of our students. It is the not the white teacher but the colored student who has the sole responsibility to succeed through societal oppression. It is no different than asking an ugly duckling to be something other than what he sees in the reflection.

This lack of having a proper role model impacts the belief a student has that they can succeed, otherwise known as self-efficacy (\cite{thevenin_mentors_2007}). With lowered self-efficacy comes lowered achievement, unsurprisingly (\cite{motlagh_relationship_2011}). Once again, the question of how these unfair societal norms factor into reducing the quality of education or effectiveness of education a student receives is rarely questioned.

The answer is not clear either. There are many variables and factors in any classroom environment that either cannot be controlled or unknown. There is no magic wand that turns poverty-stricken neighborhoods into more privileged ones, nor is there one that removes racial inequality within a school, never mind school districts across a nation. Microaggressions, including unvocalized assumptions, towards minority groups often go unnoticed and continue to feed racism. As a result, impacted students fall further into the mindset of feeling less capable in the classroom.

In particular, this happens in subjects like mathematics, widely believed to be a neutral subject. As Rochelle Gutierrez, notable for her advocacy in equitable education, writes:
\begin{displayquote}
  {[In]} many mathematics classrooms, students are expected to leave their emotions, their bodies, their cultures, and their values outside the classroom walls, stripping them of a sense of wholeness (\cite{gutierrez_embracing_2012}).
\end{displayquote}
It is not to say that finding a derivative is promoting white supremacy. Rather, the way in which we teach a mathematical concept and the myriad of assumptions we make in the process shape the role mathematics takes in our society. Because mathematics has not been discussed in this light until very recently, it is a subject to challenge and tackle the problem of the lack of self-efficacy in traditional classrooms.

While demolishing racism is ambitious, we ask in this paper a more manageable question: what can be done to raise self-efficacy among affected groups? Our answer looks into fostering self-regulation.
