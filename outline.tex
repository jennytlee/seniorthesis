        \item Descriptions of mastery, inquiry, group-based learning
        \item Focusing on how each impacted student learning
      \end{enumerate}
      \item Finding a commonality that can suggest a shift in the paradigm of learning
      \item Suggesting how self-regulation can reduce unfairness in mathematics learning
    \end{enumerate}
